# 🛠️ Automatic Tool Selection Implementation

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

The automatic tool selection system has been successfully implemented in `/api/gemini.js`. Key changes:

### Before (Mode-based selection):
```javascript
if (imageMode) {
  tools.push({ functionDeclarations: [generate_image] });
} else {
  tools.push({ google_search: {} });
}
```

### After (Automatic selection):
```javascript
// Prepare tools - ALWAYS provide both (Omnia will choose)
let tools = [];

console.log('🧠 [GEMINI] Providing BOTH tools - Omnia will choose based on user intent');

// Always add Google Search tool
tools.push({ google_search: {} });

// Always add image generation tool
tools.push({
  functionDeclarations: [{
    name: "generate_image",
    description: "Generate a new image from text description",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        prompt: { type: "string", description: "Detailed description of the image to generate" },
        imageCount: { type: "integer", description: "Number of images to generate (1-4)", default: 1 }
      },
      required: ["prompt"]
    }
  }]
});
```

## 🧪 Test Cases to Verify

Run these tests in the Omnia application to verify automatic tool selection works:

### 1. Google Search Query
- **Input**: "What's the current weather in Prague today?"
- **Expected**: Should use `google_search` tool
- **Look for**: 🔍 search notification and web sources

### 2. Image Generation Query
- **Input**: "Generate an image of a red sports car"
- **Expected**: Should use `generate_image` tool
- **Look for**: 🎨 image generation and displayed images

### 3. Text-Only Query
- **Input**: "Hello, how are you today?"
- **Expected**: Should use no tools, just text response
- **Look for**: Direct text response without tool usage

### 4. Mixed Intent Query
- **Input**: "Tell me about Prague and generate an image of Prague Castle"
- **Expected**: Omnia should choose one tool based on primary intent
- **Note**: Google limits to one tool call per request

## 🔍 Debugging Logs

When testing, watch for these console logs in the backend:

```
🧠 [GEMINI] Providing BOTH tools - Omnia will choose based on user intent
🔍 [DEBUG] Auto mode - both tools available: 2
🚀 Sending to Gemini 2.5 Flash with tools: 2
```

If Omnia chooses Google Search:
```
🔍 Google Search detected for request: [requestId]
```

If Omnia chooses Image Generation:
```
🎨 [GEMINI] Function call detected: generate_image
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

- **Smart Selection**: Omnia should intelligently choose the appropriate tool based on user intent
- **No Manual Mode**: Users no longer need to switch between search/image modes
- **Single Tool Usage**: Only one tool will be used per request (Google API limitation)
- **Backwards Compatibility**: 🎨 Image button can still be used for dedicated image generation mode

## ✅ Implementation Status

- ✅ Backend automatic tool selection implemented
- ✅ Both tools always provided to Gemini
- ✅ Logging added for debugging
- ✅ Ready for testing

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Test the three main scenarios above
2. Verify tool selection is working as expected
3. Address any save/sync issues after confirming tool selection works
4. Consider implementing dedicated 🎨 button behavior for image-only mode
